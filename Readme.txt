Business Workflow :

Weather Cities page

1.Page first load :
   - Only show search city textbox and search button.
   - Value of search city textbox is clear.

2.Search button click :

   - User does not input search city name, click on Search button

       --> System will show error : Please input search city name
       --> Data table is clear

   - User input search city name, click on Search button

       -->System will search correct city name in database (uppercase and lowercase is OK)
             --> If city name is not exist in database
                 --> Show message : Not match result data found

             --> If city name is exist in database
                 --> If found city list matches with search city name
                     --> For each city in city list
                      --> Call API of openweathermap base on cityId
                      (because have city with same name and country, but different city_id. If get current weather data base
                      on city name and country name, that is duplicate data. So get base on city_id will return correct data)
                       --> Check data get form openweathermap
                         --> If data is valid
                           --> Delete current weather data of city
                           --> Insert new current weather data of city
                     --> End each
                     --> Get all weather logs of city list

                --> If found only one city matches with search city name
                      --> Call API of openweathermap base on cityId
                      (because have city with same name and country, but different city_id. If get current weather data base
                      on city name and country name, that is duplicate data. So get base on city_id will return correct data)
                       --> Check data get form openweathermap
                         --> If data is valid
                           --> Delete current weather data of city
                           --> Insert new current weather data of city
                       --> Get all weather logs of city
                --> Show data in page
